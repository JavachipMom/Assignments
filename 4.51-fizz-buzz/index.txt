	For me the easiest question to grasp was about the scope from those lines of code.. Understanding the different types of scopes come with more ease than it use to because of the relative to the function we’re working in. I still would say that it would take me a sec more to understand that I’m looking for scope in a certain problem but I know what to look for when I get an error usually about a certain variable or argument not being defined because it’s can’t read it from the outside..
	I believe the hardest concept for me to grasp was hoisting because I can’t quite grasp the nature of needing to declare something up top but not define it until the bottom(sounds like it has to do with the scope which makes it a little more complicated about scope than I thought if that’s the issue.) Does hoist have to do with creating placeholders for variables because we don’t know what is going to be the definition yet??
